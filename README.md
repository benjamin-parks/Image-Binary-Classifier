## Install Requirements
Node/Bun/Yarn
patience


## Install Steps
in a terminal at the root of the project, type npm i, bun i, or yarn install


## Install troubleshooting
If you run into errors with the packages installing, try this command: 
`cd node_modules/gl && node-gyp rebuild`
If successful, retry the dependency install step you used in the section above. This solved my node-gyp issues and I hope it helps.
